As I mostly work with devices in the Apple ecosystem I also often use the Apple Shortcuts for some things I need to improve or automate.
As the possibilities of Shortcuts are pretty high the real world use cases are sometimes limited. There are samples of "Split 2 Apps", "Make a GIF", "Create a meeting note" or many more. But they're mostly not that faster than clicking on "create note" in my notes app.

Today I want to share one of my use cases for Apple Shortcuts which really makes things easier for me.   
I handle my life completely by using the [Things App](https://culturedcode.com/things/) from Cultured Code. 
Doesn't matter if it's ToDos, things I need to remember or storing interesting links. For everything I use this app.

As many users I often have many opened safari tabs on iOS with things I need to remember and/or I find interesting to check back later.
But often I also forget about these tabs and always creating new ones but never check back on these links.

And this is where Apple Shortcuts comes to the party. I created a shortcut which simply get's all opened tabs from safari, creating a ToDo in Things for it with a specific `imported` tag and closes them on the browser.
With this use case I can simply import safari tabs into my daily driver Things and check back onto them or plan to check them in my weekly "link reading session" on Sundays.
