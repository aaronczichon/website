At the Conclurer GmbH we're building a digitalisation platform for the German machine industry. At the company I'm responsible for the developer team of six colleagues. I'm also planning with the company managers the main product and company strategies. Also, the support and maintenance of customers is a huge part. Taking requirements, combine them with others from other customers and create and influence the main product development.
