Together with the German training platform IT Visions I provide training for Javascript and Typescript, NodeJS and Ionic. My workshops are targeting a wide range of developers from beginners in the web world to experienced web developers which want to go deeper into Javascript or NodeJS. Teaching everyone the ability to write full server-side and client-side applications on their own is my main goal for everyone whoâ€™s attending my trainings.
