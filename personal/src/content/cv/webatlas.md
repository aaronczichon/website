The WebAtlas GbR was a web development agency which was founded by me and a friend from work. At this agency we developed different web solutions based on Javascript for web, mobile and backend. With different customers like Verivox we developed state of the art applications and using bleeding edge technologies. We discontinued the agency in 2018 because of other personal priorities.
