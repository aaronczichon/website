This text are my personal thoughts and they're only related to myself.

The thing about moving into another country is, that you have more time. This is definitely something I didn't expected.  
As you leave the friends, family and hobbies behind you got more time for yourself.  
Before I moved to Canada my week schedule typically looked like this:

Now it most time looks like this:

On how I can now do things which I wanted to do for months I'll maybe will write later but today I want to focus on something else.

With this free time you have more time to think about yourself and about what's important to you.  
People who know me knowing that I often think about work. And lately a come more often to the result that I'm getting old.  
Especially on my work related things I got back to Plain Javascript (with a bit of Typescript), HTML and CSS. I love new features of the languages and everything that's in the standard.  
But I do no longer care about the latest library and/or framework. I feel comfortable with it, not to know things about new frameworks and stuff.  
I know, that being comfortable with the language features and understanding the concepts helps me way more that learning a framework or library.  
If I ever need to use (or want to use ) a new framework it's more important that I understand the concepts and Javascript in general. Learning a specific syntax of a specific framework or library is something that is done really fast if you need it.

Another aspect is that, with my new "free time", I'm back to the mood where I love learning new things for myself or building a personal project.  
Before that I often was so exhausted in the evening that I can't see a computer for my free time. This now feels like being back in the mood of the start of my career (over 11 years ago) and I love it.
