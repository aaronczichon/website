# Hi, I'm Aaron!

The last year, March 2024 until end of February 2025, I was living and travelling through Canada. During this time I lived the 100% remote work lifestyle.   
As a Senior Software Engineer from Germany, I've been weaving my (web) tech magic since 2020 over at PlanB. GmbH.   
Previously I worked at a small startup as Head of Software Development where developed a digital asset and twin platform for the German industry based on NodeJS, Angular and VueJS.

Over the past few years of software development I wrote several apps, articles and talked at conferences. Since August 2022 Iâ€™m listed as an official [Ionic Developer Expert (IDE)](https://ionic.io/developer-experts).   
As a freelance trainer I provide workshops for NodeJS, Ionic, Angular and Javascript in general.

On my more than 12 years of experience in the software development industry I worked with small and large teams in various roles.

In my free time I love to play volleyball or go out for running, athletics and winter sports (skiing, skating and snowshoeing). I'm a huge fan of Formula 1 (yes Mercedes is still my favourite team) and on good, sunny days I love to take a ride on my motorcycle.   
Over the past years I also had different roles for volunteering in my hometown community and the local sports club from being responsible for the financial parts of the Volleyball branch, being a chairman of the club from 2020 until 2024 and now in the responsible for IT and official communications. I always got my hands in something worthwhile.

## How to communicate with me

I follow a simple rule: Async > Sync.  
The async part is followed by these ways (first one is the most preferred one):

1. Project management mention (Github Issue, Work Item, Jira Ticket)
2. Instant messaging (Slack, iMessage, Teams (if you have to))
3. E-Mail

If it has to be sync, it's important to schedule it before. This is the list:

1. Virtual Meeting (FaceTime + VS Code Live Share)
2. Slack Huddle, Zoom, Teams
3. In person meeting (if possible)
4. Classic phone call
