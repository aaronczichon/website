# Hi, I'm Aaron!

Currently I'm working remotely from Canada and calling Halifax, Nova Scotia my home away from home.
As a seasoned Senior Javascript Engineer from Germany, I've been weaving my web tech magic since 2020 over at PlanB. GmbH.
Previously I worked at a small startup as Head of Software Development where developed a digital asset and twin platform for the industry based on NodeJS, Angular and VueJS.

Over the past few years of software development I wrote several apps, articles and talked at conferences. Since August 2022 Iâ€™m listed as an official [Ionic Developer Expert (IDE)](https://ionic.io/developer-experts).
As a freelance trainer I provide workshops for NodeJS, Ionic, Angular and Javascript in general.

On my more than 11 years experience in the software development industry I worked with small and large teams in various roles.

In my free time I love to play volleyball or go out for running and sometimes athletics. I'm a huge fan of Formula 1 (yes Mercedes is still my favourite team) and on good, sunny days I like to drive my motorcycle.
Over the past years I also had different roles for volunteering in my hometown community and the local sports club from being responsible for the financial parts of the Volleyball branch, being a chairman of the whole club from 2020 until 2024 and now in the responsible for IT and official communications. I always got my hands in something worthwhile.
