Starting with a new year means it‘s time to make a little recap of the previous year.    
2025 was....interesting. It started really really nice. I was still living in Canada and enjoyed my time in Thunder Bay. While we stayed there until the end of January we used the winter wonderland for skiing and a lot of skating. It‘s hard to say, but I may never felt happier in my life than during this time. Life was easy there. No „must go“ events from family and friends (because they‘re more than 6000km away), no pressure on doing something else. Just deciding to go skating or skiing after work if the weather is good. I missed these times.   
Also the last step on our Canada year in London and Toronto was great. I usually don‘t like Toronto but we had a lot of snow back then and this made the city more charming. Loved it.

Coming back to Germany at the end of February felt different. Yes, it was great to see family and friends again. Also moving to our new apartment was exciting. Going for furniture shopping and so on felt a bit stressful but also was nice to furnish all the rooms.   
What does feel weird since we‘re back is everything related to friends. Somehow things have changes. Old friends (which also barely stayed in contact the previous year) started to fade away. Contact and occasional meet ups are now quite rare and not what they used to be, even if we‘re friends for more than a decade and I thought they would stay.    
On the other hand, other friends where contact was not so intense even before Canada, intensified and we had a lot of fun.   
Everyone knows that friendships change but if you see such a drastic shift you struggle a little bit. I accepted it know but it was quite hard.

I‘m still at PlanB. I still love it there. Even with the usual struggles of a company that‘s undergoing some change. I love the people there, I love my work and I think I‘m not done with my knowledge and learnings there.   
After years I finally got another large project and therefore a new customer. This felt great to see another environment. And just at the end of the year it looks like in 2026 my main project is about to change once again. Exciting times.    
What didn‘t went well was my side projects. I continued to less and started none of the once on my list. I even dropped developing my Swift iOS app for bookmarks. I simply couldn‘t find the motivation for it after work.   

Speaking of free time: For myself I‘ve done a lot for health and sport this year. There are 2 important changes. First we changed the volleyball club which we play for. This was a hard step (also related to the friends section above) but I‘m glad I did it. The new team is awesome and the people are nice. Love it there.    
As we started we a lot of running during our time in Canada, I also kept this habit in 2025. I participated in a local running cup with 8 runs during the year. I participated in all 8 of them and finished 2nd (of 173) in my age group. That felt good and gives me a huge motivation boost to keep it up for 2026.    
Another thing I‘ve done related to health was, that I nearly stopped consuming alcohol. Not because it was at a critical level. More because during my time in Canada I nearly trank none and coming back I don‘t feel like „liking“ it. I still hate all the sweet stuff and like the taste of a good beer. But I switched to alcohol free ones and they‘re also great. I also stopped it because I see significant improvements on my athletic accomplishments. And that‘s motivation enough.

## 2026

So, after this rollercoaster year of 2025, what‘s coming up this year now?   
Well, Canada. Just the last days we booked a 3,5 week trip in August to Whitehorse. There we want to make a road trip to Tuktoyaktuk and the Arctic Ocean. I really looking forward to this one.   
In February we attend some hockey games at the Winter Olympics in Milano and, maybe, in June we go a few weeks to Sweden.    
Work-wise I hope for existing projects and more personal development. I want to improve my capabilities outside my usual work environment. Also I want to extend my self hosting environment to decouple my life even more from US companies. Maybe I even pick up Rust programming again. We‘ll see.

Until then,   
Aaron
