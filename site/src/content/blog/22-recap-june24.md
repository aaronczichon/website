Another month is in the books. June was insane.

Right at the start of the month I flew back to Germany because my sister had her wedding. Although I wasn't amused about the timing (it was starting to get nice in Newfoundland) I was glad I did it.  
I stayed at my parents home for 12 days and it was nice to see the family, friends and some colleagues again.  
The weather was nice and the wedding was wonderful as I expected it.  
The good part was, that I travelled only with carry-on baggage and that was super nice and smooth.

Back in Newfoundland the weather was mixed. But we could do some really nice hikes, went out with the boat and met new people.  
The best part of my time in Canada so far is, that I met so many nice people outside the bigger cities.  
They are open to have a longer chat, taking you on a boat trip or inviting you over to their houses. I really enjoying that part.  
More about my time in Newfoundland can be found on my <a href="https://canada.aaronczichon.de/en" target="_blank">dedicated Canada website</a>.

On the work side I'm bit proud that I got more into some side projects. This helps currently a lot for my self development and trying new technologies as at PlanB. I currently stuck in the same projects for nearly 4 years. It's a good project and it is working smoothly but it's an Angular application with little room to bring in new technologies and features. I need some new challenges.

For the statistics of June I collected some which are interesting to me:

- I hiked 46,7km (it's less compared to May which was 73,15km)
- I've done 5 runs in total (with 24,11km combined)
- My current pace for running is an average of 4min 43 sec (which is okay with all the wind here)
- So far I read 10 books this year (my goal was 8)
- I only watched 10 episodes of TV shows and 1 movie in June (most of the episodes where watch during the flights)
