Recently I found on the internet this beautiful [website](https://defaults.rknight.me/) where [Robb](https://rknight.me/) was talking about app defaults in the linked podcast episode.
I found it very entertaining that so many people respond with blog entries about their app defaults.
So this is my approach to contribute to this list. Maybe you find something new (or old). Let me know if you also have such a list!

**📨 Mail: Apple Mail / iCloud Mail and Outlook (MS Office)**  
Private and personal mails are located on iCloud with iCloud Mail and custom domain. Also using Apple's default apps for it. Everything work related is going with Outlook as by policy.

**📝 Notes: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**  
Love the approach that my notes are not locked-in into a system and they're plain markdown files. So if I ever want to switch to another app I can grab my files and pick another app.

**✅ To-Do: [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (mac, iOS, iPadOS)**  
My go-to apps since years. Would be lost without them. Quick add feature on macOS is a life-saver during the daily business.

**📸 Photo Shooting: iPhone 15 Pro Max**  
Switched to a iPhone 15 Pro Max back in November from an iPhone 12 Pro. The screen is to big for me but the camera is great. Also I hopefully get a Fujifilm X100VI in the next months.

**🌆 Photo Management: iCloud Photos + Synology**  
I store every Photo onto iCloud Photos which is my single source of truth. Even if I take pictures with a "real" camera I import them always into iCloud. I do backups of iCloud Photos from time to time to my [Synology Diskstation](https://www.synology.com/en-global/support/download/DS415+?version=7.1#system) (which is old but does the job).

**📆 Calendar: iCloud Calendar + [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)**  
As provider for my calendars I use iCloud (or Office 365 for work) and as Apps I use Fantastical on mobile and Apple Calendar on macOS.

**🗄️ Cloud File Storage: iCloud Drive**  
Is store there everything. It's, like with the photos, my single source of truth.

**📥 RSS: [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i) + [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)**  
Feedly is my "backend" for this which syncs across devices. As an interface for it I use NetNewsWire on mobile and desktop.

**👥 Contacts: iCloud**  
Like with iCloud Drive and Photos.

**🔖 Bookmarks: [Anybox](https://anybox.app/)**  
I'm so grateful that I found this app. Stores everything I find on the internet and I'm interested in.

**📖 Read it later: [Anybox](https://anybox.app/)**  
I find it, I tag it for "reading". Works for me.

**💰 Budgeting: Something self configured with [Directus](https://docs.directus.io/)**  
I've setup a Directus instance on my server for me. Using a database structure there to track my expenses. Works for me like a simple spreadsheet.

**🎸 Music: Apple Music**  
Switched to it from Spotify 3 (or maybe 4) years ago when Spotify destroyed their app with that Podcast stuff. Never regretted it.

**💻 Code Editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**  
It's the best. Period.

**🗃️ Databases: [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)**  
Whenever I need to check something in databases visually I use TablePlus. It's the best app for the job. It's one of the apps where I don't think twice to renew the license every year.

**🚀 Launcher: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)**  
Easy. Lightweight. And works (instead of Spotlight sometimes).

**🐘 Mastodon: Mammoth**  
I consume and use Mastodon only on my mobile. An I found Mammoth the best app for it.

**🦊 Browser: [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/) (macOS) + Safari (iOS/iPadOS)**  
Firefox is still my most favorite browser. And I avoid Chromium-based stuff wherever I can. Hopefully we get full Firefox with Gecko on iOS (thanks to EU)

**💬 Chat: [iMessage](https://support.apple.com/messages) + [Signal](https://signal.org/)**  
I hate Whatsapp and do everything to avoid it.

**🎙️ Podcast: Apple Podcasts**  
This is an ongoing thing. Was at Downcast for years. Was also happy with Castro (until they shook things up) and now I'm at the default because it has great Apple Watch support (for running e.g.)

**🔐 Password Management: [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/)**  
Love it that Strongbox works on a Keepass database. Gives me control over my database and the interface I'm using for it.

**🗺️ Maps: Mostly Apple Maps**  
It got really good in recent years!

**📚 Reading: [Tolino Shine 4](https://mytolino.de/produkte/tolino-shine/) + Physical Books + [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)**  
I actually hate eBooks and love to buy physical books. But as I'm currently travelling through Canada I can't take real books with me so I bought a eReader called Tolino Shine 4. It does the thing.
I track progress and what I want to read with the Goodreads service.

**✍️ Blogging: [Astro](https://astro.build/) + Markdown**  
Created my new website using the Astro framework. Content is written using simple markdown files.

**📊 Presentations: Powerpoint, sometimes Keynote**  
For work mostly Powerpoint as the integration into Teams sharing is quite good. Sometimes I use Keynote also.

**🖥️ Terminal: macOS Terminal + [OhMyZsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/)**  
Sticking to OS default apps. macOS Terminal app works fine for me with OhMyZsh. Often also use the VS Code integrated terminal.

**🛍️ Shopping List: Apple Reminders**  
The grocery shopping list is the only thing in my Apple Reminders app because I share this list with someone.

**🖋️ Journal: [Apple Journal](https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2023/12/apple-launches-journal-app-a-new-app-for-reflecting-on-everyday-moments/)**  
I used Day One, then migrated to Obsidian but there it felt wrong. Thankfully Apple came up with an app in the last fall and I'm using this one right now. It's quite basic but I want to write my day down somewhere so that it's out of my head. Don't really care where.

**📲 VPN: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)**  
Have some devices in my Tailnet and it's just awesome. If you have more than 2 devices I would always recommend setting up a Tailscale network.

**🔀 Version Control: [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/)**  
Don't like Git UIs. That's why I'm sticking to the CLI.

**🤳 Screenshots / Screenrecordings: [Droplr](https://droplr.com/)**  
Bought a lifetime license a few years ago. Is actually the first app I install on every new computer. because it automatically can upload a screenshot and I can share the link directly.

**📁 Backup: Time Machine to an external SSD + Synology Diskstation**  
I have an external SSD where I do my Time Machine backups. Also from time to time I connect to my Synology Diskstation (using Tailscale) and make a backup there as well.

**🛜 Going online: [Airalo](https://ref.airalo.com/3xBM) + [Satellite](https://www.satellite.me/)**  
Currently in Canada I still have my German phone number (which is on a 2€ prepaid eSIM) and I'm using Airalo for a data only eSIM and the Satellite app. I have call forwarding set up from my personal number to my satellite number so I can pick up calls through the data network instead of the phone network without any costs and still use my German number (which is with me for like 16 years).  
Props for eSIM. They make travelling easy and cost efficient.
