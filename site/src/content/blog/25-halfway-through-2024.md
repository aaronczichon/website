The year is halfway through. But the nice thing: another 6 months are still ahead.  
The last months where a rally for myself.

January and February were flying by because I need to pack my life into boxes and to dissolve my flat.  
Meeting most of the family members and friends one more time before moving was also packed into these two months.
Then, on 1st March I started into the adventure of moving to Canada for a year.  
And what should I say? It was superb since then. Staying two months in Halifax, 2,5 in Newfoundland and now in Montreal. I saw so many things, met a lot of people and had the best scenery’s and landscapes I’ve ever seen in my life.

I currently also struggle a bit on how the future could look like. Especially after the time in Canada coming back “home” to Germany next year.  
I’m not sure where I want to life. Going back to the small village currently feels wrong but I also not sure where I should life instead.  
That’s something I need to figure out the next months.

People know that I was in Canada a few times in my life. What most don't know: Until now I've never been here in the summer. The closest time to summer was in early and mid June. But being here in July, August and September is and will be my first time.  
I know the fact that it can be very hot here in the summer but it was hard the last 1,5 weeks in Montréal with temperatures between 30 and 34 degrees. The lowest we got in the nights was 24.

## Work

My best parts of the last 6 months are, that I build two of my websites from the ground, this one here and my Canada blog.  
Both of them are developed using the Astro framework. It feels incredible to learn something new in a few weeks and I think I'm now pretty familiar with the framework and it's capabilities. Had a lot of fun building these websites.  
I also constantly improving and adding new features to them.  
With the Obsidian location plugin I developed my first open source plugin for Obsidian which has a small but consistent user base and lately I also got a contributor which helps me adding new features to it.

## July

If I take a closer look to the last month, July it was a travel month.  
On the weekends we travelled from Brighton to St. John's to St. Pierre back to Nova Scotia to Halifax and finally to Montréal. All of this with a few days off but mostly while working. It was hard. No doubt.  
The nice thing is, that I keep my sport activities no matter what happens and this is something good for me. As well as reading nearly every evening in books instead of watching TV or movies.

Some statistics from July:

- I hiked 49,29km
- I’ve done 5 runs in total (with 27,86km in total)
- My current pace for running is an average of 4min 57 sec (which is decreasing in the last weeks and I need to figure out why)
- I only watched 1 episode of TV shows and 1 movie in July
