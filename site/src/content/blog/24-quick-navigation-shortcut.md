Picture the following situation.  
You're new to a city and you doesn't know your surrounding area very well. You often need to pick up your phone to navigate to a specific location.  
This, for example, can be the location of your accommodation.  
So to navigate to a specific location you need to re-enter it every time to into the app and start the directions again.  
That can be annoying.

I find myself currently often in this situation and I want to quickly store a location for later (because that's the point where I want to go later on the day) and then starting the directions with a single tap instead of re-entering the address again.

For this situation I build 2 shortcuts using Apple Maps and the app [Data Jar](https://datajar.app). Data Jar is a pretty simple but useful app because it let store key-value pairs on iCloud and write / read them through a shortcut.  
So I created a first shortcut which can take a location as input from the share sheet and stores this location into a data jar key called `currentTargetLocation`:

Then I create a second shortcut which I call `Navigate to üìç`. This shortcut reads the key `currentTargetLocation` from the data jar store and opens the Apple Maps walking directions to that point.

If I now place this second shortcut to my home screen I can simply tap it and get directly the directions from my current location to the stored location.

A new location can simply be stored by selecting one on Apple Maps, clicking the share button and sending it to the shortcut `Store location`. Simple as that!
