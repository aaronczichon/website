As many people currently updating their app defaults list, I'll use the time for an update of my list as well. 

I divided it into 3 sections. First is `New / Added` which is all that's new since the last version. In `Changed` is everything where I changed the app or service or removed/added something to the existing ones. Last, but not least, is the `Unchanged` section. These are the consistent parts which are still the same since the last issue of the App Defaults.

## New / Added

**📑 Clipboard Manager: [Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy)**   
All the years I though that I don't need a clipboard manager. I was wrong. Maccy is super simple but yet powerful. Safes my life multiple times a day.

**🔄 Sync: [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)**   
Additional to my document sync via iCloud for syncing things I use more and more Syncthing. Open source and powerful sync engine. Only annoying thing is that there is no iOS app (which has technical reasons).   
I've never had something that is that reliable as a Syncthing service running on my NAS.

**🔌 APIs: [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.com/)**   
I used Postman for years but it got slow and overwhelming over the years (and also requires you to have an account).   
There is something similar (very similar) that is Open Source called Hoppscotch. Use this for nearly everything now.

## Changed

**🐘 Mastodon: [Orbit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/saturn-mastodon-for-everyone/id6502952407)**  
I still consume Mastodon only on my phone. But I switch apps regularly as I haven't found the perfect solution for me. Any recommendations?   
Previously: [Mammoth](https://getmammoth.app/)

**📆 Calendar: iCloud Calendar**  
I stripped out the Fantastical app completely. They seem to shift more and more to business users only and it got expensive. I'm surprised how well the default calendar apps work for me.   
Previously: iCloud Calendar + [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

**🦊 Browser: [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) (macOS) + Safari (iOS/iPadOS)**  
Firefox is still my favourite browser. To bring some change in the UX concept I'm currently mostly using the early version of the Zen browser (which is based on Firefox and you simply could bring your Firefox account). Still waiting for Gecko Engine on iOS / iPad OS.   
Previously: [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/) (macOS) + Safari (iOS/iPadOS)

**📚 Reading: [Tolino Shine 4](https://mytolino.de/produkte/tolino-shine/) + Physical Books + [The Story Graph](https://thestorygraph.com/)**  
For tracking my book challenges and progress I switched to `The Story Graph` as I want to strip out Amazon-related stuff (and Goodreads belongs to Amazon).   
Previously: Tolino Shine 4 + Physical Books + [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)

**📊 Presentations: [iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter), sometimes Powerpoint**  
iA Presenter helps to solve me 2 problems:   
First, I hate creating presentations, with iA Presenter it's less annoying and second: I can create them with markdown. And this wins me always over.   
Previously: Powerpoint, sometimes Keynote

## Unchanged

**📨 Mail: Apple Mail / iCloud Mail and Outlook (MS Office)**  
Nothing has changed here. Full-time job still requires me to use Outlook. For everything else it's iCloud.

**📝 Notes: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**  
I recently cleaned up my tags on my notes from more than 7 years. They now clean and perfectly prepared for the new year. Also my Obsidian Location Plugin soon gets an update. Stay tuned for that one!

**✅ To-Do: [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (mac, iOS, iPadOS)**  
More than 8 years in usage now. This year I more often considered moving to something else as there is one key feature missing which I sometimes need: Notifications based on location.

**📸 Photo Shooting: iPhone 15 Pro Max**  
Shot all my photos this year in Canada. Would do it again this way.

**🌆 Photo Management: iCloud Photos + Synology**  
I store every Photo onto iCloud Photos which is my single source of truth. Even if I take pictures with a "real" camera I import them always into iCloud. I do backups of iCloud Photos from time to time to my [Synology Diskstation](https://www.synology.com/en-global/support/download/DS415+?version=7.1#system) (which is old but does the job).

**🗄️ Cloud File Storage: iCloud Drive**  
Is store there everything. It's, like with the photos, my single source of truth.

**📥 RSS: [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i) + [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)**  
Feedly is my "backend" for this which syncs across devices. As an interface for it I use NetNewsWire on mobile and desktop.

**👥 Contacts: iCloud**  
Like with iCloud Drive and Photos.

**🔖 Bookmarks: [Anybox](https://anybox.app/)**  
I'm so grateful that I found this app. Stores everything I find on the internet and I'm interested in.

**📖 Read it later: [Anybox](https://anybox.app/)**  
I find it, I tag it for "reading". Works for me.

**💰 Budgeting: Something self configured with [Directus](https://docs.directus.io/)**  
I've setup a Directus instance on my server for me. Using a database structure there to track my expenses. Works for me like a simple spreadsheet.

**🎸 Music: Apple Music**  
Switched to it from Spotify 3 (or maybe 4) years ago when Spotify destroyed their app with that Podcast stuff. Never regretted it.

**💻 Code Editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**  
It's the best. Period.

**🗃️ Databases: [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)**  
Whenever I need to check something in databases visually I use TablePlus. It's the best app for the job. It's one of the apps where I don't think twice to renew the license every year.

**🚀 Launcher: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)**  
Easy. Lightweight. And works (instead of Spotlight sometimes).

**💬 Chat: [iMessage](https://support.apple.com/messages) + [Signal](https://signal.org/)**  
I hate Whatsapp and do everything to avoid it.

**🎙️ Podcast: Apple Podcasts**  
This is an ongoing thing. Was at Downcast for years. Was also happy with Castro (until they shook things up) and now I'm at the default because it has great Apple Watch support (for running e.g.)

**🔐 Password Management: [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/)**  
Love it that Strongbox works on a Keepass database. Gives me control over my database and the interface I'm using for it.

**🗺️ Maps: Mostly Apple Maps**  
It got really good in recent years!

**✍️ Blogging: [Astro](https://astro.build/) + Markdown**  
Created my new website using the Astro framework. Content is written using simple markdown files.

**🖥️ Terminal: macOS Terminal + [OhMyZsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/)**  
Sticking to OS default apps. macOS Terminal app works fine for me with OhMyZsh. Often also use the VS Code integrated terminal.

**🛍️ Shopping List: Apple Reminders**  
The grocery shopping list is the only thing in my Apple Reminders app because I share this list with someone.

**🖋️ Journal: [Apple Journal](https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2023/12/apple-launches-journal-app-a-new-app-for-reflecting-on-everyday-moments/)**  
I used Day One, then migrated to Obsidian but there it felt wrong. Thankfully Apple came up with an app in the last fall and I'm using this one right now. It's quite basic but I want to write my day down somewhere so that it's out of my head. Don't really care where.

**📲 VPN: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)**  
Have some devices in my Tailnet and it's just awesome. If you have more than 2 devices I would always recommend setting up a Tailscale network.

**🔀 Version Control: [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/)**  
Don't like Git UIs. That's why I'm sticking to the CLI.

**🤳 Screenshots / Screenrecordings: [Droplr](https://droplr.com/)**  
Bought a lifetime license a few years ago. Is actually the first app I install on every new computer. because it automatically can upload a screenshot and I can share the link directly.

**📁 Backup: Time Machine to an external SSD + Synology Diskstation**  
I have an external SSD where I do my Time Machine backups. Also from time to time I connect to my Synology Diskstation (using Tailscale) and make a backup there as well.

**🛜 Going online: [Airalo](https://ref.airalo.com/3xBM) + [Satellite](https://www.satellite.me/)**  
Currently in Canada I still have my German phone number (which is on a 2€ prepaid eSIM) and I'm using Airalo for a data only eSIM and the Satellite app. I have call forwarding set up from my personal number to my satellite number so I can pick up calls through the data network instead of the phone network without any costs and still use my German number (which is with me for like 16 years).  
Props for eSIM. They make travelling easy and cost efficient.
