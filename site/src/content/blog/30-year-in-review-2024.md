Another year in the books. And hell, this was a good year. Probably the best year in my entire life. But let's start from the beginning.

## Goals for 2024
As mentioned in last [years review](https://aaronczichon.de/blog/year-review-2023/) I'm normally set myself some targets for the upcoming year with a [friend](https://philippreiner.com/).     
My major goal for 2024 was: `Having fun in Canada!`.    
As already mentioned last year, 2024 was the year of moving to Canada for 12 months. This journey started in March and is still ongoing. But more to that later.    
The second goal was `Find the best way between work, life and volunteering balance that works for me`. And this is a tough one. It's an ongoing process.   
I learned, that I can't do that much on volunteering for e.g. the local sports club as I used to do the past years. And I now know that this is fine. I was using much of my free time for activities around our volleyball team or the sports club in general. 2024 and the time in Canada has shown me, that I need more time for myself. I love doing this stuff but it shouldn't be done at the costs of my personal health and relaxation time.    
The third and last goal was, that I wanted `to get a clear view on how and where I want to live 2025 and onwards` and I completely failed with this one.    
I don't know where I want to live. I love larger cities, I love small towns and I love the village where I grew up. And this is a problem. I really enjoyed the last months travelling through Canada and living at a different place every 2-3 months. And as this time is coming to an end in February, one thing I currently know for sure is that I'll miss it. 

## Year at a glance

In 2024 I also tried something new. The year before I saw on some blog (sadly I don't know which one it was) the `year in a glance` approach. The idea is simple yet genius. Create a spreadsheet with a column of every month and number all the rows to the dates. Now you have a simple calendar at one glance of the whole year. Write in every field the highlight of that day.   
If you like you can do this also physical on paper.    
And now, after I take a look at this sheet it feels like: `did I really do all that stuff this year?!`. It was a lot. And I will keep that habit. It brings a nice overview of what happend in that year.

## Canada

Let's go to the second largest country in the world.    
2023 was in preparation to organize everything for the 2024 Canada year. And with arriving the 1st of March it was finally there. I moved out of my apartment where I was living for 8,5 years, packed nearly everything I own into boxes, stored them by my parents and siblings and took the flight to Halifax.    
I was so exited and I wrote so much about my time in Canada that I have an extra [website for this](https://canada.aaronczichon.de).    
The main takeaway of this time is: you learn so much about a country, culture and people if you live there for a longer time. It was a perfect decision not to stay at one place for the whole year. Travelling through the country and stay 1-3 months at a location was inspiring and so fun.    
Starting from Halifax on the east coast to Newfoundland. Going to MontrÃ©al in summer and travelling with an RV to Toronto. Flying to Winnipeg and then another road trip to Calgary via Regina and Saskatoon. Staying in Calgary where we got 3 seasons: summer, autumn and winter.    
Flying to Whitehorse and travelling Yukon and Alaska was maybe the best part (if I had to choose between all these great things) for me. The landscape and the people are different. Yukon felt for me like `the real Canada` (if there is such thing).    
Making this step, working 100% remotely and travelling through my most favourite country in the world, was the best decision I've done in all these years. It also proves that you can and should take risks even if you're grounded for several years in your area with friends and family. It helped me a lot to get new views on nearly everything.   
I'm sad that it will be over at the end of February but also looking forward to the next two months with joy and what they will have for me!

## Work

My work year has two sides: One that was exciting because I went fully remote and within different timezones and one that was pretty boring.    
I'm in the same project since 4 years and we done there some really great things. One of the customers developers and myself started together with building the platform. The team grew over the years to 14 people and different modules and areas on the project. It now serves many people at the customers daily life and is constantly evolving. From being one of the developers, I went to be responsible for the general direction on the platform and to coordinate people, modules and customer requirements. It was fun. But also I feel like it's time for a change. So I hope that I get the chance in the next year to work for other projects (and/or other customers) at PlanB.   

At the end of February I thought I could be tough to work fully remotely. Not only because of the different timezones but also not seeing the people in person. As well as not having a fully set up workplace like I had at home with display, desk and so on.   
There are a lot of things I learn. First of all: It's totally fine to work only on your notebook/laptop. I got used to it and you don't need a fancy keyboard, display or whatever. I sometimes only wished for a good office chair. But everything else? It's just gimmick.   
If you coordinate your schedule right, different timezones are not a problem at all. I actually believe it helped the team to grow and improve documentation and asynchronous work. I also think I was more productive this year than ever simply because of the fact that I got the afternoon for myself. People in Germany usually then in their evening so I got no distraction to work on code, preparations, reviews and so on. I really enjoyed it. It also confirmed (what I already used to know) that remote and asynchronous work is the future for developers.   

A good friend of mine, who's also working at PlanB., and I are also pushing more and more standard libraries which we developed for our colleagues. Definitely something we can go even further and make projects more easier for our customers.

## Side projects

Every year I set the goal to work more on side projects. And this year I finally made some progress here.   
In May I published my first open source plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). A nice plugin to add locations to your notes as an image. It got a nice, small user base and version 2 is just around the corner!

I also created the new blog for the [Canada trip](https://canada.aaronczichon.de) with Astro and moved my personal site (this one) also to Astro. Both of them are now running on Cloudflare Pages.   

Just 2 weeks ago I moved from my old webspace, which I had for years, to a VPS (also from Netcup) where I now host most of my things. I finally can deploy some docker containers for myself on the internet. That's awesome (and I learned a lot about infrastructure once more).

## Friends

I'm thankful for my amazing friends. Especially for these which visited me during my time in Canada. Whether it was in Newfoundland or in Calgary. I loved it and enjoyed the time with them so much. Thank you all!   
Obviously the same for my parents and my sister of course ðŸ˜Š

## Health

I really enjoyed this part this year. I'm fit and healthy like I never was.    
I reduced alcohol consumption by about ~70% this year. I kept the habit, which I started at the end of 2023, with running and went running 45 times, which is an increase of 87%.   
We even participated at a run in Calgary and I ran my best time on 5K ever.   
I also went hiking a lot more. I already loved it but at home there is not so much where I can do it. But in Canada I went so much hiking like I never was before. Exploring the nature at different parts of the country was relaxing and calmed me down every time after work or after a work week.

Despite I nearly never watched TV or movies at the first half of the year that changed at the end of the year with the winter weather. I'm using the same table like last year but with updated numbers:

| Year | Type     | Watched Hours |
| ---- | -------- | ------------- |
| 2020 | Movies   | 69            |
| 2021 | Movies   | 70            |
| 2022 | Movies   | 35            |
| 2023 | Movies   | 18            |
| 2024 | Movies   | 56            |
| 2020 | TV Shows | 477           |
| 2021 | TV Shows | 364           |
| 2022 | TV Shows | 331           |
| 2023 | TV Shows | 157           |
| 2024 | TV Shows | 138           |

As you can see I'm no longer watching so much TV shows as I used to do. The time watching movies increased a lot. That's probably mostly because of the many flights I took this year. I nearly every time watch movies on flights.

My favourite new hobby I started/improved this year? (Ice) skating. I learned it years ago but I never was really good at it. Since the winter started here in Canada I go skating at least 5 times a week. I'm getting better and better. I recently learned the "hockey stop" and skating backwards. It's so fun and I now get it why Canadians love it so much. It's always fun!

## 2025

For the first time I don't care what's coming the next year. I still have two months in Canada and will return to Germany at the end of February.   
I still don't know where I'm going to live then but I'm totally fine with it. I want to go with my siblings on vacation next year. That's the only thing we currently plan to do. Everything else: I don't know. And that's good.
