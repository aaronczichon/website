Over the last 4,5 years, I was working in a team that mostly worked remotely.   
I always see discussions about whether working fully remotely is good or bad for the working culture. What I learned about this narrative is that the answer is not so simple. As often in life, this is more a question of "it depends."   

But what are the factors that make a team work remotely? What's the definition of "remote work"? And lastly, can you adopt it for your team?

## The Definition
The definition of working remotely depends on whom you ask.   
In Germany, there is (like for everything) an official government definition of what types of remote work exist. Depending on which way you or your employer choose, this even affects your taxes.   

Basically, there are two types: home office (mobiler Arbeitsplatz) and remote work (Remote-Arbeitsvertrag).    
The first one defines that you normally work from an office but sometimes you don't, like a typical split in your week with working 3 days from the office and 2 days from home. In that case, there are some regulatory requirements for your employer. For example, they need to make sure that you have an ergonomic office chair, an external keyboard and mouse, and a display. Employee safety is something important in Germany, and there are even requirements, like the ones I mentioned, for office workers.    
In this concept of "mobiles Arbeiten" (translated to "mobile work"), you are allowed to work from everywhere, which has the goal of bringing the employees some flexibility in their daily lives. In this scenario, the employer needs to tell the employee that he/she is responsible for using proper equipment.   

The second type of remote work is, well, remote work (Remote-Arbeitsvertrag). In that case, your primary work location is your home. So you do not have the tax benefits of getting a tax return for driving to the office. On the other hand, your employer can't force you back into the office. In that case, your employer is also not responsible for your equipment in the office. So they don't have to provide you with a chair, desk, and so on inside the office when you're there. But they need to provide it for you in your home.    
But wait. Why would you want this if you can't get a tax return? Well, you can, but another form of tax return. In that case, you can get a return for a room/space inside your home or apartment which is **only** used for work. You can even get a tax return for your internet connection. 

It gets tricky for people who are working from somewhere else.    
Let's take me, for example. I was working from Canada for the last year. I changed my location there every 2-3 months. I was never in the office (except for a few days in the summer). Is this now "home office" because I don't have an equipped environment at home? No, because I was not only "sometimes" at home. I was always "at home." So it's remote work then? Well, also no. And here we are, in the twilight zone and something I need to figure out with my tax advisor.

My personal definition of remote work is if you work most of the time, which is at least 4 days a week, outside the office. This can be a workation, your home, or abroad. Everything that's not the office.

## Remote Teams
As we have now clarified the definition of "remote work" (at least partly), we should define a remote team.   
Our team has 12 members. We're a mix of people from my company, external suppliers, and people from the customer.   
Two of the customer's people are working mostly from the office, so they see each other nearly every day. The rest of us are spread throughout the world. I was working from Canada; we have people across Germany, one in Spain, India, and Bulgaria.

## Syncing and Meetings
In a team that is spread across the globe, it's important to commit to certain processes.   
As we're working with an Agile approach which is Scrum-like, we have sync meetings which are on a daily or weekly basis.    
With the different time zones, it's not easy to get everyone into a daily standup sync. Therefore, we created different time slots for the daily meeting.    
For example, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the standup took place at 09:00 am CET, and on Tuesday and Thursday at 03:00 pm CET. This gave everyone the ability to join at the time best fitting their schedule.   
Every couple of months (2-3), there are in-person events for 2 days where we discuss larger topics and future developments for the coming weeks. You cannot fully quit in-person meetings, but you can concentrate them on certain days. They can also be combined nicely with team-building events.

Besides the daily standup meetings, most of our communication works asynchronously. We use Teams and a group chat there for short-term syncs, and most of the "real" communication works through issues (work items) on Azure DevOps.    
On the issues, clear outlining and requests are important. To avoid a few back-and-forth assignments, we discuss a feature/bug/improvement most of the time in the comment section of an item. As soon as all things are clarified there, we can provide a proper description for the item itself so that the person to whom it gets assigned knows what he or she needs to do.

## Pitfalls and What You Need
The most important part of an asynchronous work environment is simply: everyone needs to know that we're working asynchronously.    
This basically means: No one should expect to get an answer in the next 5 minutes. If you get one, you're probably lucky but shouldn't expect it every time.   
Different time zones and asynchronous work mean trust and commitment on all sides. People in another time zone have another day schedule, and some may have kids or appointments during the workday. But this doesn't mean people don't do their jobs.    
I personally see a lot of benefits in remote teams. The focus on the actual work is much higher (I can even measure that in my output), and the asynchronous communication forces everyone to clearly define their requirements and feedback in chats, issues, and work items. This also results in a very nice side product: you get a much better documented product than you would have gotten from a team sitting in the same room all day.

Remote teams are not for everyone. As you may also have seen, there are plenty of discussions on platforms like LinkedIn, Mastodon, and Reddit. Some people want to force everyone to be back in the office, and some are from the team "no office at all."    
My personal answer to this would be: Give your people the option for both or something in between. Not everyone is more productive in a remote environment (home, workation, coffee shop) than in an office. And it's also clear that the output is the thing that needs to be measured. If you're not doing your actual work remotely, your employer may need to bring you back to the office.    
But on the same page, this is something you should consider the other way around. If someone gets distracted a lot in the office, maybe he/she should try working from home?    
I also heard a lot from people that they like to mix and match things here. Working 1-2 days from the office and 3-4 days from home. That's also fine.   

Especially in Germany, where a constant lack of good people in IT is the norm, we should provide a work environment which fits best for them. And usually, these changes don't cost the company much but have a major impact on the productivity of a team. In both ways. In the office, remote, or hybrid.
